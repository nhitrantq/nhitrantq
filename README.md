Hey there ðŸ‘‹ !!

My name is Nhi Tran.

I am PhD with a specialization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. 

Currently i'm working as Lead Data Scientist for a chatbot factory solution at Invivoo.

Here is a summary of studies on chatbot's NLP that I published in [Invivoo github](https://github.com/xcomponent/chatbot-nlp):

- Data augmentation for intent prediction: [data_augmentation_for_intent_detection.ipynb](https://github.com/xcomponent/chatbot-nlp/blob/main/data_augmentation_for_intent_detection.ipynb)

- Compare TF-IDF and BERT-based features for intent classification [compare_tfidf_vs_bert_features_in_intent_classification.ipynb](https://github.com/xcomponent/chatbot-nlp/blob/main/compare_tfidf_vs_bert_features_in_intent_classification.ipynb)

- Identify similar intents groups by clustering on semantic features: [identify_similar_intents_by_clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/xcomponent/chatbot-nlp/blob/main/identify_similar_intents_by_clustering.ipynb)

- Identify similar intents groups by clustering on semantic features: [identify_similar_intents_by_clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/xcomponent/chatbot-nlp/blob/main/identify_similar_intents_by_clustering.ipynb)

- BERT fine tuning for intent classification: [BERT_fine_tuning_intent_classification.ipynb](https://github.com/xcomponent/chatbot-nlp/blob/main/BERT_fine_tuning_intent_classification.ipynb)
